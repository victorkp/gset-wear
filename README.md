## Project Details ##
This is the code for the "The Next Step in Computing: Wearable Devices" home automation project at NJ Governor's School of Engineering and Technology. The goal was to make a home automation project in which Glass would be able to control various pieces of hardware (by relaying messages through a server to a microcontroller of some sort).
